# Starter

This project is a starter kit for designing [Blogifier](https://github.com/blogifierdotnet/Blogifier) themes. It sole purpose is to provide a template to extend and customize Angular CLI-based application that will run under Blogifier.
It provides basic HTML templates, routing, data service, components (widgets) and so on to jump-start building your own Blogifier theme.

## Quick start

1. Requires [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to run application.
2. Copy or clone this repository to your local drive.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
